This is my 4th ML notebook. In this one, I explored the dataset with visual representation of text data and used pie-charts to illustrate sorted data.

# Context
Rolling Stone is an American monthly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco, California, in 1967 by Jann Wenner, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. And here are their top 500 picks as the greatest songs of all time.

The dataset consists of 500 songs with attributes such as title, description, artist, etc.

The data was scraped from the publicly available website https://www.rollingstone.com/
